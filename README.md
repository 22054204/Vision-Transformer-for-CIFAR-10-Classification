# Vision-Transformer-for-CIFAR-10-Classification
A Vision Transformer (CIFARViT_404) was implemented for CIFAR-10 image classification using patch embedding and multi-head self-attention. Trained on 45k images with 5k for validation, it demonstrates how transformers capture spatial features without convolution.
